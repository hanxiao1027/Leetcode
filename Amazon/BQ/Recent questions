most proud experience, why Amazon, most challenging project 
 most proud project/technical achievement. 
 tight ddl and have to make decision without considering alternatives + experience of making a decision without consulting manager
 most proud project +time when your team was facing a challenge
 outside comfort zone
 anything you don't fully understand, but you do it anyway
 你的teammate都不会做的事情，你take了responsibility
 a time when you have to deal with a tight deadline，
 interesting project和challenge
 1.问比较challenge的项目，做了啥 2. 问你项目过程中遇到的组员，比较认同和不认同的点 3.然后给了个条件，加入一个现有的项目组，你怎样在前人的基础上干活
